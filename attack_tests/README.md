# Info

In this folder, contributors are welcomed to build malicious code to try and break this implementation of the blockchain. The objective is to discover any vulnerabilities in the implementation in order to suggest enhancements in the next versions.

The library allows building a local isolated network inside a single machine or multiple machines in a local or a wide area network which comes in handy when trying to build attacks on this kind of block chains without touching a production blockchain.

Please don't  put manicious code that can harm the users. We only need the attacks to target weaknesses of this blockchain implementation to enhance its security and settle on a good Proof of stake scheme that preserves nature and security on the same time while preserving the distributed computing spirit.
